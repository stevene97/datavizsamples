# R Samples: Storytelling with R Markdown and Shiny
These samples were completed in R using a combination of a variety of packages including Shiny, Leaflet, and Plot.ly.

1. <b>Storytelling with Zillow Data: https://stevene97.shinyapps.io/Zillow_Data/</b>
- (link to repository with code in R: https://github.com/stevene97/zillow_data)


2. <b>Final Class Project: Looking at sanitary violations around Harvard Square:</b> https://stevene97.shinyapps.io/Gov1005_Final_Project/
- (link to repository with code in R: https://github.com/stevene97/gov-1005-final-project)


3. Traffic Analysis (work with the City of Cambridge): https://sespinoza-cambridgema.shinyapps.io/traffic-data/
Another example of data visualization using R/Shiny.

# Python Samples: Folium Mapping and Basic Linear Regression Sample
A compilation of data visualizations/analyses, completed mostly with Python. Found below are links that increase the interactivity of the maps made with Folium:

1. Buenos Aires Work: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/stevene97/datavizsamples/blob/master/geocoding_junio.ipynb
Sample of code used in Python to create a map showing different claims filed by citizens throughout the city. A website containing these maps as a final product for the city is given at https://sites.google.com/view/gcbareclamos-mapas/

2. Choropleth Map: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/stevene97/datavizsamples/blob/master/2016%20Primary%20Voter%20Turnout%20in%20Hialeah%20and%20Hialeah%20Gardens.ipynb

3. Heat Map (Contaminated Sites in Miami): https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/stevene97/heatmapsample/blob/master/Contaminated%20Sites%20in%20Miami-Dade%20County.ipynb

4. Basic Regression Analysis (sample, code):

Most of these are simply samples with lots of code and few comments, with the idea that the visualizations would be shared on other platforms. For example, interactive Folium maps are saved as HTML code and are intended for websites, while the plots with Matplotlib are intended to be saved as PNG images and used for Word documents or PowerPoint presentations. Actual Jupyter notebooks I regularly work on (with ample annotations, comments, etc.) are mostly done for internal use and are not meant to be public.
